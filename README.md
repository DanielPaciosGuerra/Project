This project aims to explore the relationship between NFL team's performance and their stadium's attendance .
The final plot represents every team's relationship between attendance and performance. 
To obtain the data in one data frame several merges have been done as well as other data cleaning techniques such as string detection and manipulation. 
The plot evidences there is not a strong relationship between how well/bad a team is performing and its rise/decline in attendance. 
The initial hypothesis is that if last season a team did not perform well the expectations for next season will be low and they will not attend. 
This relationship is not clear in the plot. In fact the biggest changes in attendance from a season to another are due to team's relocation (St Louis Rams to Los Angeles for instance).
In the code there is another visualization in which you can select the team and compere its progressions of both the attendance and winning percentage from 2000-2019. From that visualization we can see how bad performance can coincide with low attendance. However, the relationship is not exact, nor linear nor present for all the teams.
